This repository has the assingment for the PhD class "Statistical Methods KVHEM" at Czech Univeristy of Life Sciences. For the assignment I chose a machine learning project where I aim at predicting biodiveristy change trends from static occupancy data for breeding birds in Czech republic, Japan, New York state and Europe. The original data is closed and cannot be provided, however I tried to include a modified version for reason of reproducibility.
