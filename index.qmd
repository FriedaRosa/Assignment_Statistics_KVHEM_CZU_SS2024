[Abstract:]{.underline}

The world is undergoing significant environmental transformations, impacting biodiversity and ecosystem functions.
Since obtaining temporal replication of biodiversity data is challenging due to cost and monitoring limitations, I aim at predicting temporal trends in species occupancy without requiring temporally replicated data.

Biodiversity kinetics leave characteristics imprint in the spatial patterns that we can see from geo-referenced presence/absence data because the underlying processes such as extinction and colonization happen across space.

I aim at predicting the log ratio of temporal change in occupancy (i.e., the sum of area occupied by a species) between two sampling periods from a set of predictor variables that are either related to **H1) species traits and ecology**, **H2)  geometric features of the species range from a single sampling period**, **H3) biodiversity equilibrium dynamics via spatial diversity patterns**,  or **H4) to the characteristics of the study region** -- all of which may equally contribute and act in concert to explaining the temporal process that is underlying the spatial pattern.

For this I use high-quality, spatially continuous atlas data from four breeding bird atlases from temperate zones across the globe.
Atlas data comes with spatial grids that enable easy up- and down scaling of the data.

Here, I assess universal imprints of temporal change in breeding birds in Czech Republic, Japan, New York State and the whole of Europe across two aggregated sampling periods that took place pre-2000 and post-2000.
Since data for two sampling periods are available, I will additionally test whether imprints in the spatial aggregation of species can better predict past or future biodiversity change.

For this, I collated 60 predictor variables that vary across sampling periods - each belonging to one of the hypotheses mentioned above.
I will use random forest regression to determine the capability of static patterns to predict temporal change, identify the most important predictor variables and compare observed versus predicted results.

If my model can predict temporal change from static patterns, this method will be a useful tool for estimating temporal change in areas and for species where repeated monitoring might not be feasible.
If the models are only partially able to predict temporal trends, the important predictors may still yield insights into how temporal processes are acting across space.
Additionally disentangling whether imprints of biodiversity kinetics are better at explaining past versus future change may help to understand the temporal dimensions of the imprints.

## Adjustments to the topic

Since handing in the topic of the report, I found that the response variable that I chose did not capture much of a signal in the data which led to very poor predictive power and model performances.
The distribution of this variable was predominantly centered around zero with few extreme cases of extreme increase or decrease, while predictor variables varied heavily.
Ths suggested that there is just not enough signal in the *log ratio* for predictions.
I investigated why this was the case.
Here follows the explanation:

Log ratio of the area of occupancy (*log ratio AOO*) was calculated as follows:\
log times the product of the sum of all areas occupied in sampling period 2 (AOO 2) divided by the sum of all areas occupied in sampling period 1 (AOO1 ), i.e.,:\
$$log Ratio_{1,2} = log(AOO_{tp2}/AOO_{tp1})$$

I found that most species did not experience much change in AOO between both sampling periods, but a lot of site turnover happened.
This means that, although *log ratio of AOO* is zero, species moved around a lot.
Some even switched from a north Europe-based distribution to a south Europe-based distribution (e.g. *Vanellus vanellus*, the Northern Lapwing).

These changes were not detected at all by the metric that I chose to describe temporal change.
Thus I decided to include another metric of temporal change which better captures the spatial change that species undergo.
I calculated the *Jaccard index of similarity* for each species across their occupied sites between two sampling periods.
*Jaccard* was calculated as follows:

$$
J(X,Y) = |X∩Y| / |X∪Y|
$$

where $X$ are the names of the cells that are occupied in period 1 and $Y$ is the names of the cells that are occupied in period 2.
This results in a measure of similarity between sites that ranges from 1 (= complete similarity in sites) to 0 (= no similar sites).
This may give an idea of how much spatial change happened for each species across sampling periods.

In the following report I will still report the results for *log ratio AOO*, but these will have secondary importance and results for different response variables will be printed in separate tabs for the same analysis.
